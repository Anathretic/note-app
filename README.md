# NoteApp (JavaScript App)

## About

Web application that allows you to quickly create a note using a popup menu. Each note has category that determine the background color. Additionally, you won't create a note if you don't fill out all the fields, because save button is disabled by default.

Data is stored in localStorage, so you can safely close your browser and your notes will still be there - all thanks to the browser's storage. Of course, in a bigger project I would definitely use the REST API, but it's a small project and I just wanted to practice some features.
